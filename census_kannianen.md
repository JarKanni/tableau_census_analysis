# 1. How do people commute?

https://public.tableau.com/views/Census_Project/CommutingintheUnitedStates?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
## Summary: 
Among the available modes of transportation, Driving (orange) massively outpaces the others. Lowest three regions are Alaska (46.8%), and Hawaii (64.4%), and Montana (69.6%) with the majority ranging from 70.6-84.8%!

## Design:
- Orange and blue color scheme to help emphasize the highs (orange) and lows (blues), with added accessability for colorblindness.  Oranges on this page represent the orange of Driving
- Bar chart uses univariable design to focus on differences between transportation categories.
- Section on Driving's Dominance presents the Highest and Lowest lists help emphasize the high numbers on both sides of the range.

# 2. How often is Public Transit used for Commuting?

## Summary: 
By far, most counties in the United States have Transit Usage rates of 2% or less!  Where available, Transit sees higher usage rates (Kings, Bronx, New York, Queens, and Hudson), showing interest.  Lack of access to transit inforstructure presents a major issue to combating the high driving rates of commuters.

## Design: 
- Kept the color-blind friendly color scheme of blue for Transit
- Used a map to visualize where in the country transit is most used
- Listed top counties to show where available, Transit is used!
- To visualize the massive amount of counties with 2% or less, I plotted each as a square in a symbol map to sit the two sides next to each other for easy comparison

# 3. How long is the Average Commute?
## Link: 
https://public.tableau.com/shared/HZTCXM2PM?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

## Summary: 
Average commute time in the United States is 23 minutes, ranging from 5-43 minutes total.  This follows the population distribution across the United States, thus higher populated areas suffer higher commute times, concentrated in major cities. Therefore, Eastern half of the United States contains higher commute times compared to central and west.  Commute Times by County graph shows that as number employed increases, so does the average commute time.

## Design: 
- Blue and Orange color scheme adds accessibility for color-blindness while also emphasizing high vs low areas of concentration
- Points on the graph are right-facing arrows, symbolizing the movement and common direction of commuting with a crowd
- Map to visualizes geographic locations of high/low densities
